#Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Description

The Airbnb Clone Project is a web application inspired by Airbnb, allowing users to manage and interact with property listings. The project is built using Python and follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the application.Basic storage implementation is the serialization and deserialization of the object using the json module

## Command Interpreter

The python cmd module is used to implement the command line interpreter.

It provides a user-friendly interface for managing objects within the system, such as users, states, cities, and places. The CLI facilitates operations like creating new objects, updating attributes, retrieving information, and more.
